# LLM Document Processor

A flexible and extensible Python framework for processing text documents using Large Language Models (LLMs). Built with modularity and configurability in mind, this project enables automated analysis, classification, and processing of `.docx` (at this moment) files through customizable LLM interactions.

## 🎯 Overview

This project provides a robust foundation for document processing workflows powered by LLMs. It features configurable system prompts, comprehensive logging, and a clean architecture that separates concerns for easy extension and maintenance.

### Core Capabilities

- **Document Processing**: Automated extraction and processing of `.docx` files
- **Flexible LLM Integration**: Support for various LLM providers (currently Ollama)
- **Customizable System Roles**: Define custom behaviors and contexts for different use cases
- **Smart Text Extraction**: Automatic section detection (stops at double blank lines)
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed text-based logging of inputs, outputs, and operations
- **Environment-Based Configuration**: Secure credential and settings management via `.env`

## 🚀 Use Cases

The architecture supports a wide range of applications:

### Current Implementation
- Essay/document analysis and classification
- Automated feedback generation
- Content evaluation with custom criteria

### Potential Extensions
- **Educational**: Automated grading, feedback generation, plagiarism detection
- **Legal**: Contract analysis, clause extraction, compliance checking
- **Business**: Email classification, report summarization, sentiment analysis
- **Content**: Article summarization, fact-checking, bias detection
- **Customer Service**: Ticket classification, response suggestion, sentiment tracking

## 📋 Requirements

- Python 3.11+
- Ollama server (or compatible LLM host)
- `.docx` file support via `python-docx`

## 🛠️ Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <project-directory>
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
# or
.venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
```

3. Install required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Configure environment variables:

Create a `.env` file in the project root:
```env
OLLAMA_HOST=http://localhost:11434
IGNORED_FILE_NAME=TEMA.docx
```

5. Install the project in editable mode (for development):
```bash
cd general_study  # or your study directory
pip install -e .
```

## 💻 Usage

### Basic Document Processing
```python
from pathlib import Path
from processors import file_processor_v2
from host.ollama_client import OllamaClient
import os

# Initialize client
client = OllamaClient()
client.connect_to_host(host_url=os.getenv("OLLAMA_HOST"))

# Load system role/instructions
system_role = file_processor_v2.load_system_role_from_file(
    Path("path/to/instructions.txt")
)

# Configure processing
config = file_processor_v2.ProcessFilesConfig(
    file_path=Path("path/to/document.docx"),
    model_name="llama3.1:latest",
    client=client,
    system_role=system_role
)

# Process document
response = file_processor_v2.process_files(config)
print(response)
```

### Model Configuration

The system supports any Ollama-compatible model. Popular options:
- `llama3.1:latest`
- `gemma:latest`
- `mistral:latest`
- Custom fine-tuned models

## 📊 Logging

All operations are logged to text files for debugging and auditing:
- Input documents and extracted text
- System roles and configurations
- Model responses
- Timestamps and metadata

Log files are stored alongside processing scripts (e.g., `file-proc-log.txt`).

## 🔐 Security Notes

- Never commit `.env` files to version control
- Keep API keys and host URLs in environment variables
- Review logs before sharing as they contain processed content

## 🧪 Development

### Running Tests
```bash
# TODO: Add testing framework
```

### Code Style
- Type hints throughout
- Dataclasses for configuration
- Modular, single-responsibility functions
- Comprehensive docstrings

## 🛣️ Roadmap

- [ ] Batch processing with parallel execution
- [ ] Support for multiple LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
- [ ] Response caching to avoid reprocessing
- [ ] REST API for remote access
- [ ] Model comparison tools
- [ ] GUI interface for non-technical users
- [ ] Extended file format support (PDF, TXT, MD)
